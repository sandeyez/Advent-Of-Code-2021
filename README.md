# Advent of Code 2021
This repository shows my first participation in the Advent of Code, in 2021. The given solutions might not be the fastest, but they're what I came up with during the contest. I do try to code my solutions as clean as possible.

Each day contains a folder with a readme for the problem, the puzzle input and my solution in C#.
